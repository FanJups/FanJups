I am a passionate and fanatic learner.

As an app, I regularly update myself.

I'm a Java Software Engineer working on Open Source ( [Google's Mug Project ](https://github.com/google/mug/graphs/contributors) & [SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale's ArchUnit Build Plugin Core Project](https://github.com/societe-generale/arch-unit-build-plugin-core/graphs/contributors)) and Non Open Source projects.

I just wrote my first article : [Applying CI/CD to Java Apps Using Spring Boot](https://dzone.com/articles/applying-cicd-to-java-apps-using-spring-boot), it's a way to thank people who helped me to become the developer I am today and share my experiences.

Please, if you have a job opportunity abroad, just let me know. I am ready to relocate.
