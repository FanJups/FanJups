Contributing to Open Source projects leads me to be a GitHub Artic Code Vault Contributor. The goal of [GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/) is to preserve open source software for future generations.

On November 2019, I wrote my first article [Applying CI/CD to Java Apps Using Spring Boot](https://dzone.com/articles/applying-cicd-to-java-apps-using-spring-boot) -> [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FanJups/cicd-applied-to-spring-boot-java-app). It's a way to thank people who helped me to become the developer I am today and share my experiences.

[I started my speaking journey in 2024 as you can see here.](https://github.com/FanJups/public-speaking) To celebrate that, I published this article [OSDD: Open Source Driven Development](https://blog.osscameroon.com/posts/open-source-driven-development).
