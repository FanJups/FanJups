I am a passionate and fanatic learner.

As an app, I regularly update myself.

I'm a Java Software Engineer working on Open Source and Non Open Source projects.

Open Source projects:

- [Google's Mug Project ](https://github.com/google/mug/commits?author=FanJups)
- [SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale's ArchUnit Build Plugin Core Project](https://github.com/societe-generale/arch-unit-build-plugin-core/commits?author=FanJups)
- [Microsoft's Spring Cloud Azure](https://github.com/microsoft/spring-cloud-azure/commits?author=FanJups)
- [Apple's ServiceTalk](https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/commits?author=FanJups)
- [Open Source Society Cameroon's jsGenerator](https://github.com/osscameroon/js-generator/commits?author=FanJups)


Contributing to Open Source projects leads me to be a GitHub Artic Code Vault Contributor. The goal of [GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/) is to preserve open source software for future generations.

I just wrote my first article [Applying CI/CD to Java Apps Using Spring Boot](https://dzone.com/articles/applying-cicd-to-java-apps-using-spring-boot)-> [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FanJups/cicd-applied-to-spring-boot-java-app). It's a way to thank people who helped me to become the developer I am today and share my experiences.

I'm preparing for Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 11 Developer certification and Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer Certification by getting [Google Cloud Skill Badges](https://google.qwiklabs.com/public_profiles/2e48ffde-3e13-46d5-b825-14bbb38510a3).

Please, if you have a job opportunity abroad, just let me know. I am ready to relocate.ðŸ›«âœˆðŸ›¬
